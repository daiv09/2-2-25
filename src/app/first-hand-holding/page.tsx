        It was at someone's house where we first held hands. It was such a nice timeee. It was my first time holding a girl's hands. You have the softest hands on the world and i promised myself to never leave your hand everrrr!!! I will remember that moment for ever. Your head were on my shoulders and I remember _ and _ took a photo too. (and i look dead in it Lol..). ðŸ’–
